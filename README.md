# DiningWatchApp
This app has the purpose of answering a question that afflicts many KU every single day, "What's for lunch?".

To answer this question one would have previously had to go through piles of menus, collapsed options, and a clunky search function to see just a few of the options.

We wanted to alliviate this problem by created something accessible, automatic, and easy to use.  The product our team decided on was *What's for Lunch?*

This simple and powerful tool allows a user see only the critical information about the dining cetenr nearest to them.  This is achieved by a quick call to the paired phone's location data.  This eliminates the hastle of cycling through many menu's or having to make the same selection over and over again.  Because of the quick pull of existing data, this process is fast and not intensive on either the processor or battery

Next the user selects which time of day they plan on eating. This options are sorted into helpful *Breakfast, Brunch, Lunch*, and *Dinner* options.  In additon, the app will only show relevant meal times to the user.  For example, if it's a Sunday and the dining center of choice won't open until 11 a.m., then Breakfast will not be shown, instead the user is presented with a Brunch, Lunch, and Dinner menu
